# Find-Nearest-Marketo-Office
This example takes a user's location, and returns the nearest Marketo office location and its phone number. If a user's location is not accessible, the script defaults to Marketo's global office location and phone number.

The example uses the [Geolib JavaScript library](https://github.com/manuelbieh/Geolib) and HTML5 Geolocation API. [This blog post on Marketo Developers Blog](http://developers.marketo.com/blog/dynamically-change-page-content-based-on-a-users-location/) discusses more implementation details.
