# Find-Nearest-Marketo-Office
Example showing how to dynamically change page content based on a userâ€™s location through HTML5 Geolocation API.

This example takes a user's location, and returns the nearest Marketo office location and its phone number. If a user's location is not accessible, the script defaults to Marketo's global office location and phone number.

This example uses the [Geolib JavaScript library](https://github.com/manuelbieh/Geolib).
